# VBA Challenge
# Overview of Project
For this project we analyzed and refactored existing code so that we could gather a dataset that fit our needs i.e. made the dataset manageable and useful. The Client was researching green stocks for his parents and needed help managing and analyzing a large dataset.

## Results
Screenshots of the execution times for the refactored code are in the git hub link:
Also, screenshot of run-time before refactoring is here:

It is self-evident that our code refactoring was successful based on run-time. The time after refactoring is one quarter the timestamp before.

##Results-Favorite Stock
ENPH is the most interesting stock in the group based on its performance. In 2017 it saw an ROI of 82% and in 2018 it saw an ROI of 130%. Compared to the average stock market annual return of ~10%, ENPPH saw a 24 month return of over 200%. More research is necessary to see how sustainable this growth is, it is however, remarkable.

### Summary
	-What are the advantages/disadvantages of refactoring code?
-An immediate disadvantage for a newbie like myself is, one misstep can create other problems. I knew something had gone awry at the end of the module when adding colors to the 2017/2018 cells. I had to fix the code later to make up for this flaw and it became time consuming. 
-Another disadvantage is that the same lines of code ended up being duplicated multiple times. This admittedly may have been operator error. 
-The advantage is having good, palatable datasets for easy consumption and faster run-times. 
-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
-I think that some of my missteps could be avoided in the future with experience, and hopefully my process will become neater with time and practice
-In refactoring the original VBA code, I think that my could have been more concise.
-With the goal of having palatable data in mind, this can all still be seen as a success. In spite of some of the frustrations, the run-time was greatly decreased and the datasets match the intended dataset screenshots from the Module 2 Challenge page.
